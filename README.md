# CODESOFT: Machine Learning Internship Tasks

## Task-1. MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

Description: Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.


## Task-3. CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

Description: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

## Task-4. SPAM SMS DETECTION

Description: Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages.
